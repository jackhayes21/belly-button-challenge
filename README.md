## Belly Button Biodiversity

 ####   Howdy! Welcome to a dashboard that implicates charts and microbal species in the belly button! Who knew that there are living things in a place that no one ever thinks about that is in plain sight.

 ####   The charts pull from a dataset over a 100 OTU's(operational taxonomic units) and display different kinds of male and females. The data also contains what tyoes of belly buttons they have, age, ethnicity and location.
